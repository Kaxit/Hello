<h5>Liquidity and Risk:</h5>For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent it must be readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value. Therefore, an investment normally qualifies as a cash equivalent only when it has a 
short maturity of, say, three months or less from the <b style="background-color: aqua;">date of acquisition</b>.

  Illustration 5 : An entity has entered into a factoring arrangement and received money from the factor. 
  Examine the said transaction and state how should it be presented in the statement of cash 
  flows
  <p>Under factoring arrangement, it needs to be assessed whether the arrangement is recourse or 
  non-recourse.</p>
  <p style="background-color:white;">Recourse factoring:</p>

  <p>The <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">cash received</span></b> is classified as a <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">financing cash inflow</span></b> as the entity continues to recognize the 
    receivables and the amount received from the factor is indeed a liability, The substance of the 
    arrangement is financing, as the entity retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of the 
    factored receivables. 
    When the <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">cash is collected by the factor,</span></b> the liability and the receivables are de-recognized. It is 
    acceptable for this to be disclosed as a <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">non-cash transaction,</span></b> because the settlement of the 
    liability and the factored receivables does not result in cash flows. The <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">net impact</span></b> of these 
    transactions on the cash flow statement is to present a <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">cash inflow from financing</span></b>, but there is <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;"></span>no 
    operating cash flow from</span></b> the original sale to the entity’s customers.</p>

  <p style="background-color:white;">Non-recourse factoring:</p>
  <p>Where an entity de-recognises the factored receivables and <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">receives cash from the factor</span></b>, the 
    <b><span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red 50%, blue 50%); background-clip: text;">cash receipt is classified as an operating cash inflow</span></b>. This is because the entity has received cash 
    in exchange for receivables that arose from its operating activities.</p>
