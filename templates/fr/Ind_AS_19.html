    <h1>Objective of Ind AS 19 (Employee Benefits):</h1>
    <p>To provide <u>Accounting & Disclosure for employee Benefits</u></p>
    <p>Recongise:</p>
    <ui>
        <li> <u>a liability</u> when an employee has provided service in exchange for employee benefits to be paid
            in the future; and</li>
        <li><u>an expense</u> when the entity consumes the economic benefit arising from service provided by an
            employee in exchange for employee benefits.</li>
    </ui>
    <hr>
    <h1>Scope:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>This Standard shall be applied by an employer in accounting for <u>all employee benefits</u>, <u>except
            those to which Ind AS 102 </u>, Share-based Payment, applies.</b></li>
        <li>This Standard <U>does not deal with reporting by employee benefit plans.</U></li>
        <li>The employee benefits to which this Standard applies <u>include</u> those provided:
            <ol type="a">
                <li title="applies: Formal plan/Agreement"> under formal plans or other formal agreements between an entity and individual employees,groups of employees or their representatives; (i)</li>
                <li title="applies: legislative requirements/industry agreements">under legislative requirements, or through industry arrangements, whereby entities are required to contribute to national, state, industry or other multi-employer plans; or (i)</li>
                <li> by those informal practices that give rise to a constructive obligation. <p>Informal practices give
                    rise to a constructive obligation where the entity has no realistic alternative but to pay employee
                    benefits.</p> An example of a constructive obligation is where a change in the entityâ€™s informal
                    practices would cause unacceptable damage to its relationship with employees.</li>
